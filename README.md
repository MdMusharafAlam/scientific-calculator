## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator.git
    cd scientific-calculator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it does not open automatically, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the calculator to perform various operations:

- **Basic arithmetic:** Click on the number and operator buttons to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced functions:** Use the trigonometric and logarithmic buttons to perform advanced calculations.
- **Special functions:** Calculate factorial or generate a random number using the respective buttons.
- **Clear display:** Press the "AC" button to clear the display and reset the calculator.
